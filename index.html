                        AccuTrack is an intelligent IOT system that can track the way a blue collar worker moves, while they are working, and determine their risk of ergonomic Injury. We have developed custom built flex sensors that bend with the way a persons limbs moves. These sensors can be attached to clothing at the elbows and knees to track the angles of these limbs. It transmits this data to the cloud in order to recognize risk of repetitive strain injury, overworking, and poor posture. We use Azure IOT to coordinate all of our hardware sensors. The backend includes Azure SQL to save the user data and Azure App Service with a Machine Learning pipline to process the information to provide ergonomic insights. The web portal is currently live at <a target=_blank href="http://www.accutrack.me">accutrack.me</a>.

					 	The SeeMe project uses hardware sensors, Azure, and Xamarin to track elderly in their home to determine if there might be a problem. It uses custom hardware
						sensors in order to track the location of the person in the house and sends this information to a Python Flask app running in Azure. The app saves this data
						to an Azure SQL DB including the room entered, the time entered at, and how long they stay there. The Python app regularly uses this information to retrain a 
						Tensorflow model which predicts how long a person will stay in a room. If they stay too long, the system sends an alert to the caretakers mobile phone saying that 
						there might be a problem. The system also finds concerning movement that my be early onset of dementia, insomnia, and other conditions.

						objects of interest that Google Vision finds is then related to your genome. For instance, taking a picture of a treadmill would show your genome
						information on endurance, a picture of a cake shows your likelihood of diabetes, etc.

					 <summary><p class=description>EzBot is a microcontroller and software package I developed over the course of 3 years. EzBot has pins to connect multiple servos, lights, speakers and sensors. Without any programming, users can use the EzBot mobile app to wirelessly control all of the hardware they connected to the board. This is done using the built-in drag-n-drop layout creator within the app. The EzBot app also hosts a server that allows the phone to become part of the robot and connect to another phone or computer on the WiFi. A python and C# library was also developed for more advanced control of the EzBot.

					 <summary><p class=description>For the Genesys Hackathon we decided to create an application that performs facial and emotion tracking for client-representitive video calls. The benefit of this application was to ensure that the customer was not confused or angry during a call, track customer information (age, gender), and notify the supervisor if the customer was getting upset. We used Mircosoft's Face/Emotion API and fed it screenshots from the video call as Genesys did not support 3rd party video monitoring. The emotion/facial tracking results were then sent to Firebase which was pulled from a web app that displayed all of the information in tables and graphs.</p>

The purpose of the project was to automate the process of providing medicine to those with dementia that live in group homes. The hole in the front cover is where the phone sat and acted as an interactive display that showed the amount of pills and any information about a patient. The pill dispenser connected online and provided a notification on the screen when it was time to dispense somebody's pill. We made a web portal for doctors to use in order to update the medication remotely which would be updated in the dispensebot real-time.</p>

                     <summary><p class=description>During highschool I frequently visited the school's computer engineering lab, but usually found it locked. As my final project, I decided to fix that by installing a touchpad on the outside of the door that allowed only myself and a few close friends to enter the lab with a code. The keypad connected to the Arduino which verified the code and engaged a servo to pull the door handle up and play a song. We installed a camera to see who tried to enter the combination incorrectly and generated an image using a Python program. We found janitors, teachers, and the occasional frosh trying to crack the code!</summary><br/><ul class=skills>

This prompted me to created a switch system for the two servos that allowed me to control a lot more motors in the project. The robotic arm has 4 DOF and rotated on the spot because of the mechanism I implemented for steering.</p>
