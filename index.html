					 <summary><p class=description>EzBot is a microcontroller and software package I developed over the course of 3 years. EzBot has pins to connect multiple servos, lights, speakers and sensors. Without any programming, users can use the EzBot mobile app to wirelessly control all of the hardware they connected to the board. This is done using the built-in drag-n-drop layout creator within the app. The EzBot app also hosts a server that allows the phone to become part of the robot and connect to another phone or computer on the WiFi. A python and C# library was also developed for more advanced control of the EzBot.

The purpose of the project was to automate the process of providing medicine to those with dementia that live in group homes. The hole in the front cover is where the phone sat and acted as an interactive display that showed the amount of pills and any information about a patient. The pill dispenser connected online and provided a notification on the screen when it was time to dispense somebody's pill.
