Lassonde Hackathon - Roambot
<br/> <br/>
Roambot was a project I completed for Local Hack Day at York University in 8 hours. <br/>
The robot was controlled by a person's movement which were detected by an Xbox Kinect.<br/>
The computer sent the Kinect's command using UDP to an Android phone that was sitting<br/>
on the robot.The Android then sent the same instruction over Bluetooth to the Arduino <br/>
which controlled the motors to drive while also streaming video of what the robot sees <br/>
back to the computer (video was 3rd party). Worked independently.<br/>

Unfortunately no video of me jumping around in front of the Kinect to make the robot move. Sorry :(
