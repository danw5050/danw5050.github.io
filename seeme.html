		SEEME Project
		<br/>
		
		<p>The SeeMe project tracks elderly in their home to determine if there might be a problem.</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Hardware sensors located in each doorway determine where the person is located in the house</li>
			<li> Flask Python app running in Azure saves this sensor data to Azure DB Table</li>
			<li> Python app regulartly retrains Tensorflow model using the DB data which predicts the length of stay in the room</li>
			<li> Flask app sends notifictation to the Xamarin mobile app about location in the room, and the prediction</li>
			<li> If elderly person stays in a single room far beyond the prediction, Xamarin mobile app shows warning </li>
		</ul>
		A more descriptive explination can be found in the competition submission document <a href="./seeme.pdf">here</a>
